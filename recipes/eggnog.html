    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This eggnog recipe for thick, creamy, and sweet eggnog with just the right amount of spice took several years to perfect. The egg yolks are tempered for safety, and you can adjust the amount of rum to taste, or leave it out entirely so the whole family can enjoy this rich holiday treat. It's a bit of work to make but well worth it. Once you taste it-you'll never serve store bought eggnog again!</p>
